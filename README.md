# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger App is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a "devoure it!" button asking for it to be dovoured.


Operation:
When the  `Devour it!` button is clicked, the associated burger will move to the right side of the page. There is "trash" button by each burger on the right side of the screen. This button makes it possible to permanently delete the burger from this side. The  App stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The follwing tolls were used in the creation of the  burger logger App: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM. the MVC design pattern was also employed.
